# To do 365
Hi evryone, this new project had concepted by me, the ideia is make the same appplication two times, we are in five friends, one of us gonna be a auxiliar analyst and the others will be divided in two pairs.

The project is a calendar with a "To do list", it will created in a web application, so, each pair will be divided in back-end and front-end.

We gonna name the applications like "To-do-365-A" and "To-do-365-B", when we've decided the pairs, this readme will be actualized with the colaborates names in their respectives pairs. 

The use case diagram was created using the UMLet puglin in VScode.
